        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          As a full-stack developer, I specialize in creating web applications
          that solve real-world problems. My expertise spans from crafting
          responsive front-end interfaces to designing robust back-end systems.
          I'm particularly drawn to projects that combine artificial
          intelligence with practical applications, always looking for ways to
          make technology more accessible and intelligent.

          The chatbot you're interacting with represents my passion for AI and
          basketball. Built with modern web technologies, it uses advanced NLP
          techniques to understand user queries and seamlessly translates them
          into SQL operations through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. This
          allows users to interact with databases using natural language rather
          than complex query syntax – making data more accessible to everyone.

            When I'm not coding, you'll find me following the latest NBA games
            and analyzing player statistics (which actually inspired some of the
            sports-related features in this chatbot). Basketball has taught me
            the value of teamwork, strategic thinking, and continuous
            improvement – principles I apply to every development project.

            I'm excited about the future of AI and web development, particularly
            in creating applications that understand and respond to human needs
            more intuitively. Whether it's through intelligent chatbots, data
            visualization tools, or interactive web experiences, I'm always
            exploring new ways to make technology work better for people.
